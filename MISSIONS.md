# Missions overview

There are 25 missions, each with a short scenario, a goal, and a lightweight auto‑checker.

Open the app → **Missions** tab to browse them. Click **Load Starter** to drop a sample stack into the workspace.

Notable missions:
- **Star‑Logo Sketch** — 5‑point star with ~144° turns.
- **Square Room Clean** — repeated ~90° turns (room traversal).
- **Arrow‑Key Rescue** — drive via keyboard to reach a coordinate region, then add a `turn 90` block.

Mission definitions live directly in `index.html` inside the `LESSONS` array.
