# Roadmap (suggested)

- Sprites: swap shapes, add costumes
- Variables: number/text and “set/change” blocks
- Conditionals: `if`, `if/else`
- Collisions: simple tile/collider helpers
- Save/Load: export/import workspace JSON
- Share: copy a link with encoded program
- Sound: simple beep library for rhythm missions
- Accessibility: high-contrast palette toggle
